# GUI_Game

A game which has me nostalgic mostly bc of GUI. User authentication with registration and login--still work in progress. 

The game launcher connects the two classes 

the game itself is also a work in progress. First started as high/low then a picture guessing game now trying to use AI integration for a space raiders esc 
game. for now graphics are basic, but with progression hoping for better 2D scripts.
